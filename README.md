## FAQ

Currently it does not support custom configuration.
However if you find most of my colors look great and you want to make minor customization, you can follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme) and use `workbench.colorCustomizations`.

Since it's an early version, it's still improving and may update in the future, Please let me know if there are any improvements you want to make, enjoy!

Love to all Genshin Impact player and developers!

p.s. I do not own the icon and this is definitely not official.
