## FAQ

Currently it does not support custom configuration.
However if you find most of my colors look great and you want to make minor customization, you can follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme) and use `workbench.colorCustomizations`.

Love to all Genshin Impact player and developers!


## Progress

In the lastest version red and green colour are converted for better React.js development experience. 
Trying to add more variant colors such as different characters in the future, stay tuned.
